[![Big image, shows a picture of "Domain Knowledge", "Tech" and "Design" all pointing to a sign that says "Users". The Goal: Products that work like magic. I love developing websites and apps that deliver magical experiences and provide real value. My work includes taking on roles as a developer, a designer, organizing project specs, business models and talking to experts in all kinds of different fields.
